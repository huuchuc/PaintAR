# PaintAR
Augmented reality application
<br>
This is my first 3D application for mobile devices and it's based on Vuforia framework.
You may need some skills in using Unity3D, Maya, and also have experience in C# development. 
With some simple fuctions that help children learning to draw easier and more creative.
